# Description
Blackjack Incremental is an incremental game inspired by Blackjack. Unlike typical Blackjack, there is no dealer, instead you earn points based on your hand's total score compared to Blackjack, with upgrades to increase the amount of points you get and what number Blackjack actually is. Jacks, Queens, and Kings are also worth 11, 12, and 13 points respectively, and Aces are always worth 1 point."
